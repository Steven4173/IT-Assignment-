	<p>Both my parents are from Vietnam but I was born here in Australia. The highest form of education that I have completed is highschool. I speak mainly English and Vietnamese at home. I've also studied Japanese at highschool but I still have much more to learn. In my spare time, I occasionally play a few music rhythm games. I mostly play online but recently I've been going to the arcade with friends. I tend to just watch but it's still fun going out and about.
  
<h2 style="color:orange;">Interest in IT</h2>

	<p> My interest in IT began recently when I was graduating from highschool and had to think about my future careers. Feeling as though I was always surrounded by technology, I found myself having a sense of familiarity with what IT had to offer in terms of careers. When I was in highschool, it was often that my teachers would have trouble with their technological devices. They would contact the IT department to troubleshoot their problems and that made me wonder about the other kinds of work they did. I came to the conclusion that they were most likely responsible for the school’s front website and intranet. I hope as I continue to learn, I will come to realise more about the work they were doing as well as about the IT world and the plethora of career options.
  
	<p>What I expect to learn from my studies is the ability to efficiently work with already existing software, hardware, programming skills and the ability to adapt my knowledge around what others or myself need. I chose to go study at RMIT due to their good reputation within the fields of technology, as their way of teaching leans towards the more practical side rather than theoretical. It is also conveniently close to where I reside.</p>
  
<h2 style="color:orange";>Ideal Job</h2>
	
<img src="job.jpg" alt="job">
	
    <p>The position includes working with a product development team to advance and push forward a website. It will be used to display the new communication solution which is currently in development. I find this particular position appealing as it allows me to work in a team with potentially like minded people. Also, rather than working by myself, working alongside others will support me in honing and expanding my knowledge and skills in web developing. </p>
    <p>This position includes a requirement of many set skills such as HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, GitHub. Experience in commercial experience, other scripting languages such as PHP, and templating languages are also seemingly important in fulfilling this position effectively.</p>


	<p>As for experiences, skills, and qualifications, I have yet to develop them to a satisfactory level. In terms of skills, I look forward to getting familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Github. I have no real experience and qualifications for the position. Perhaps an internship at a company in my laters years of studying will allow me to gain the right experience I need for this position. I expect the ability to self-learn to be extremely helpful when keeping updated with any potential updates, changes, or additions to the way software, hardware and programming languages work. </p>

	<p> Overall, the results of these tests accurately conclude that I’m more of an introvert than I am an extrovert. Although through personal experience, in most situations I find myself able to communicate and exchange my ideas with others in my team quite easily as long as I’m confident in what I am saying. Given my team are agreeable, open, and are generally nice people I would find it a normal part of my day to communicate my thoughts with them. </p>
	
	<p> What ‘intuitive’ means to me is how I tend to think about how different the world would be given different scenarios and events both on a small and large scale. Although, sometimes it’s better to see things as how they are and not to get too carried away by imaginations. More often than not, I believe that having someone remind you of what’s actually possible and what’s not possible yet is incredibly helpful to avoid getting too ahead of oneself. </p>
	
	<p>I find that my ‘prospecting’ trait tends to be a personal weakness more than anything. I get distracted easily and sometimes detach myself from what needs to be done. I’m rarely the initiator and controller of events - instead I find myself to be the reactor of my surroundings and adapt my behaviour accordingly. At times, I do believe that I’ll be better off if I grow towards a ‘judging’ personality in the future. I lack discipline and concentration in things that I find uninteresting despite knowing how important some things are which need to be finished. Although, it’s not as if I lack discipline and concentration in everything I do. I just need to learn how to apply it into other areas of my life and have my mind set in the right place. However, I find that when I’m working with people who are focused in the right environment, it helps me significantly to stay on track with what I need to do. </p>
	
	<p>Being more of a visual learner, it will reflect the way I try to convey my ideas with others. Diagrams and pictures will prove to be useful to represent and store them. It may also be helpful, if my team felt the same way, for our work be stored in a visual format when it is most suitable. </p>
