  <p>Both my parents are from Vietnam but I was born here in Australia. The highest form of education that I have completed is highschool. I speak mainly English and Vietnamese at home. I've also studied Japanese at highschool but I still have much more to learn. In my spare time, I occasionally play a few music rhythm games. I mostly play online but recently I've been going to the arcade with friends. I tend to just watch but it's still fun going out and about.
